EXPLANATION TO PARTICIPANTS 

SELF-ASSESSMENT STUDY PROGRAM 

INTRODUCTION 

This study booklet provides a valuable study program and should prove to be the most 

significant part of the Self-Assessment Study Program for you. You are urged to set aside 

time on several different occasions to analyze your reasoning processes as compared to 

those of the Examination Committee. To properly complete this part of the learning 

experience, it is estimated that you will need to spend approximately 20 hours reading 

references and related materials. 

It is important that you carefully read the comments to understand why the answer is 

deemed the "best answer." You may have selected the correct answer but your logic in 
selecting it may differ from that of the Examination Committee. It is also very important to 
obtain and read the references given so that you may gain the maximum benefit of this 
Self-Assessment Study Program. We recommend that you do this reading even if you

selected the correct answer to the question. 

In closing, we recommend that you save and file all of your Self-Assessment Study Program 

materials. They will assist you in comparing your progress when reviewing the next SASP, 
and will remain valuable resource information for your practice. 

SCORING 

Your results are based on the total number of points you scored out of the possible 750 for 

the entire examination; 5 points for each correct answer. 

In the Comments and References Section, the response which is deemed to be the correct 
answer is provided.

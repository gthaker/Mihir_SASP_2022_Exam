Target Audience: This self-assessment program is designed for practicing urologists, Board candidates, residents and/or physician assistants. 

Purpose/Need: Urologists and other health care providers need to assess their knowledge of urology. Identified gaps in this knowledge can lead 
to individualized, practical educational activities, which will result in improved patient care. 

Learning Objectives: After completion of this continuing medical education activity, including this examination, participants will be able to: 

• assess their knowledge of urology 
• demonstrate an increased knowledge base of urology 
• apply their knowledge to improve quality of patient care 
• evaluate their strengths and weaknesses in urology 
• develop a personalized study program 
• review basic and advanced urological guidelines 
• discuss core knowledge of urology necessary for the ABU's Qualifying and Lifelong Learning Examinations

Self-Assessment Study Program 

INTRODUCTION 

This Self-Assessment Study Program is designed to provide practicing physicians, Board candidates, 
and residents with an assessment of their knowledge of urology and to be a valuable learning 
experience which should add significantly to their store of knowledge. In addition, expectations 
are that there will be an improvement in the quality of care delivered to their patients. Relative 
strengths and weaknesses in urology will be immediately apparent upon review of the 
personalized Participant Profile. All data concerning results of the Study Program are strictly 
confidential and elaborate security measures have been set up in the Office of Education to ensure 
that only the individual participant has access to their scores. 

The Self-Assessment Study Program may be completed under either open or closed book test 

conditions. We urge participants to select the examination condition with which they are most 
comfortable. Open book implies the use of references and other resource materials. Closed book 
implies that reference materials are not used. To ensure a fair comparison, peer group reports are 
compiled separately for the "open book" and "closed book" groups. 

Participants who desire CME must score a minimum of 50% and may take the SASP under 
either closed or open book test conditions. An additional answer sheet is provided to retake 
the examination for credit if the 50% benchmark has not been met. 

The purpose of the program is self-assessment and learning, NOT an evaluation of the participant 

by the American Urological Association or any other agency. The examination is designed to be a 

valuable learning experience as well as a self-evaluation and therefore is considered to be a valid 
measure regardless of open or closed book conditions. 

The examination items require a recall of medical knowledge and application of clinical 
experience. Time should be taken to consider each item carefully. We strongly recommend 

blocking out three to four hours to take the examination in one, or at most, two sittings. The 

examination should not be stretched over multiple sessions. Participants should select one answer 
that they feel is the best. At the completion of the exam, it is important for the learner to read 

very carefully the comments and recommended resources as to why the answer is deemed to be 
the "best answer". 

Immediately after completion, participants return their answer sheet to the AUA Office of 
Education. EACH WEEK answer sheets are scored and personalized. Participant Profiles are 

compiled and mailed along with an evaluation or a second answer sheet to retake the exam. 
Certificate of Completion for CME credit is available online at AUAnet.org/University. 

At the end of the year, peer group reports will be compiled. In order for scores to be included in 
the peer group data, completed answer sheets must be in the Office of Education before October 

1, 2022. After the final weekly scoring, peer group reports will be sent to all participants who 
returned an answer sheet. Included in this report will be an overview of your personalized 
Participant Profile. 

Finally, we hope that the Self-Assessment Study Program is found to be a stimulating, informative, 

and beneficial tool for Continuing Education as you strive for high-quality patient care.
